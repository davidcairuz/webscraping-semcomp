https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/,synopsis,"Lord Voldemort, an evil and powerful dark wizard, has just been defeated. When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron). Harry enters the wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). Hagrid takes Harry to Gringott's Bank, where Harry learns that he is quite wealthy. Following this, Hagrid stops at a different vault to retrieve a small, wrapped parcel for Dumbledore. Using his newfound money, Harry buys everything he requires for his first school year, including and owl, and a wand. Interestingly, the wand that chooses him is the brother wand of the one that was used to kill Harry's parents and give him the scar. He then takes the train to Hogwarts from Platform Nine and three-quarters, befriending Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and meeting Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), a Muggle-born witch.Upon arrival, the Sorting Hat places Harry, Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor House. Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), an arrogant and elitist student, gets placed in Slytherin. At the end of their first week at Hogwarts, Harry and Ron discover that Gringotts, the wizarding bank, was broken into and a vault that Harry and Hagrid visited had been the subject of the robbery. Later, Harry discovers he has a talent for riding broomsticks, and after an incident with Malfoy, is recruited to join Gryffindor's Quidditch team as a Seeker, much to Malfoy's displeasure.Harry, Ron, Hermione explore Hogwarts late at night and accidentally stumble across the door to a corridor. A three-headed dog, christened Fluffy by Hagrid, guards a trapdoor. On Halloween, Quirrell informs everyone that a troll has entered the castle; Harry and Ron fight the troll to save Hermione, who is trapped in the girls' bathroom, and the three become best friends.At Harry's first Quidditch match, Harry's broom becomes possessed, nearly knocking him off. Hermione sees Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), the sinister Potions master and head of Slytherin House, staring at Harry and mouthing words, making her believe that Snape has caused the broom to misbehave with a dark curse. Hoping to save Harry, Hermione sets Snape's robes on fire, distracting him and others and allowing Harry to survive.At Christmas, Harry receives an Invisibility Cloak, once belonging to his father, which renders its wearer invisible. Harry uses it to explore the Restricted Section in the library to research information on Nicolas Flamel, a name Hagrid lets slip when confronted about his knowledge of Fluffy. Eventually, Harry learns that ""Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone, which produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal.""Harry sees Snape trying to get information from Quirrell about getting past Fluffy; Quirrell says he does not know what he's talking about. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sure that Snape is trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone in order to restore Lord Voldemort to power, but Hagrid denies it. While at Hagrid's hut, the trio discover a dragon egg Hagrid was nursing in a fire. Later the egg hatches a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon, and Hagrid decides to call him ""Norbert"". The friends are nervous for Hagrid, since dragon breeding had long been outlawed in the wizarding world, and Hagrid had something of a reckless nature, who has long since nursed a strong desire for a dragon. Finally, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to convince Hagrid to let Norbert go live with other dragons of his kind in Romania.Harry, Hermione, Ron and Draco are caught out late at night, and are forced to serve detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. Harry sees a hooded figure drink the blood of an injured unicorn, which makes Harry's forehead scar start burning. Firenze, a centaur, tells Harry that it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn, let alone drink its blood. He also tells Harry that unicorn blood will keep one alive, and that the hooded figure is in fact Voldemort.Harry, Hermione and Ron find out that Hagrid has told a hooded stranger how to get past Fluffy, and they believe the theft of the Stone is imminent. Rushing to finally confide in Professor Dumbledore their news, they meet Professor McGonagall, who is shocked to find out how much they knew about the Stone, but reassures them all the same that it is safe in the castle. She also tells them that Dumbledore has been sent away on an important mission by the Ministry of Magic. Positive that Dumbledore's summons was a red herring to take Professor Dumbledore away from Hogwarts, the trio make plans to thwart Snape's theft of the stone. They set out to reach the stone first, navigating the security system set up by the school's staff, which is a series of complex magical challenges. The three make it through together until finally, Harry must enter the inner chamber alone. There he finds that Professor Quirrell, not Snape, is attempting to steal the Stone. Realizing that Snape was trying to protect him from harm all along, Harry confronts Quirrell and survives a second encounter with Lord Voldemort, who has possessed Quirrell and appears as a ghastly face on the back of Quirrell's head. Quirrell crumbles when he touches Harry's skin, and Harry passes out because of his close proximity to Lord Voldemort. Voldemort then pitilessly abandons Quirrell, who dies in the aftermath of his possession.Harry wakes up in the hospital wing. Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Harry's mother died to protect Harry as an infant. Her pure, loving sacrifice provides Harry with an ancient magical protection from Voldemort's lethal spells and also prevents Voldemort from touching Harry without suffering terribly. Dumbledore also says that the Sorcerer's Stone has been destroyed to prevent future attempts by Voldemort to steal it.Finally, at the end-of-year feast, the House Points totals are given: Gryffindor is in last place. However, Dumbledore gives a few ""last-minute additions"", granting points to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville for their bravery and service towards school, so that Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12214738/,summary,A Machine to Live In is a hybrid documentary linking the cosmic power structures of the state to the mystical architecture of cults and utopian cities in the remote hinterlands of Brazil.
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12214738/,summary,"A MACHINE TO LIVE IN is a documentary feature about cosmic dreams and mystical architecture at the heart of Brazil's remote wilderness. Through an emergent polyphonic text composed of four personalities, the film moves from the hyper-designed, space-age city of Brasília to the vast and flourishing landscape of UFO cults, spiritist temples, and utopian outposts. Brasília, a sixties-era megaproject, is a crumbling monument to an obsessively rational dream of state power. Lined with massive concrete domes, pyramids, and geometric ""superblocks,"" the city resembles a highly-planned moonpad in some outdated sci-fi vision of the future. A future where an ultra-rational urban design produces the ultra-rational citizen, living harmoniously in machine-like order. Yet the people who arrived to witness this utopian project in the hinterlands were themselves possessed by their own powerful visions of the future. Over the decades that followed, this region of Brazil became home to the densest concentration of new religions, cults, and transcendental movements in the world. The film examines these utopian relics as if it were a sentient data processor, assembling fragments of texts, songs, and interviews from four iconic witnesses to Brazil's experiment in world-making: the writer Clarice Lispector; the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin; and the followers of linguist L.L. Zamenhof, inventor of Esperanto; and Tia Neiva, Brazil's first female truck driver and charismatic cult leader. Through these oneiric visions, the film describes a destabilizing multitude of futures: ""I have never seen anything like it in the world."" Lispector writes, ""But I recognize this place at the very core of my dreams.""—Yoni Goldstein"

When Lum answers where she lives, the old man cackles with joy, claiming that he will come to claim her when she is older to take her to a dark place.Lum wakes from her dream and asks Ataru for console, but he refuses to listen to her concerns. Growing frustrated with his attitude, Lum zaps him and flies away. Eventually, Ataru encounters Sakura and Cherry, who soon after encounter 3 bad omens in a row: Sakura's sandal thong snaps, a black cat appears, and a hearse soon drives past.Back on her UFO, Lum receives a message from her parents, claiming they found her Great-Grandfather, who somehow had his sleeping chamber misplaced when the family moved some time before. Having never met his Great-Granddaughter, Lum's parents invite her to meet her elderly relative.Meanwhile. Ataru, Sakura, and Cherry have returned to Sakura's temple, and consult a crystal ball for more information about the bad omens they encountered. Lum soon appears in the crystal ball, and is slowly swallowed up in darkness. As Ataru leaves, Lum's words about the dream she had flash through his mind, and he rushes back to his home, only to find Lum gone. Lum's nephew Ten explains that Lum left, but does not say where to.Arriving at her parent's place, Lum finds her Great-Grandfather, who upon seeing that Lum is a girl, begins to sob uncontrollably. Noone can figure why this is, until a dark figure (whom Lum recognizes from her dream) appears at the door, and Lum recognizes the figure from her dream.Upon seeing the dark-cloaked stranger, Great-Grandfather then relates a story from a long time ago, where the dark figure came upon him, weak from hunger. Great-Grandfather was offered two mushrooms to choose from, one of which was poisoned. Great-Grandfather chose the poison mushroom, and in exchange for the antidote, agreed to let the dark-cloaked man marry one of his daughters. However, even though he was dying, Great-Grandfather tricked the old man, claiming he had only sons. The stranger then vowed he would return to claim the first daughter born into the bloodline, which now happens to be Lum. The cloaked figure claims that since he is too old, he intends Lum to be the bride to his Grandson, Rupa. This revelation is soon met with the family tossing the old man out of the house.The next day on Earth, Rupa arrives at Tomobiki High School looking for Lum. Upon finding her, he places a strange ring on her finger, claiming it will make her an adult sooner. Lum attempts to take the ring off, but it won't budge. It turns out that the ring is actually an accelerator mushroom that will cause Lum to mature to the point where she will lose her oni horns.This occurs the next day, and with Lum now being powerless, Rupa abducts her and Ten. Upon finding out, Ataru, Mendo, Oyuki and Benten 'borrow' Ran's spaceship, and head for Rupa's home planet.

In the scuffle, Rupa's Grandfather hides Lum in a hidden room, and uses a decoy to distract Carla and Ataru. Ataru asks the decoy-Lum to come with him, but she claims she wants to stay with Rupa. Carla again demands Rupa come with her, but when he refuses again, she threatens to kill him before she kills herself. The fight then escalates up to the roof where Lum has also come about.Rupa's Grandfather attempts to help him and Lum escape in a hot-air balloon. Lum begs Ataru to help her, but after being fooled by the decoy, he refuses to assist her. In the meantime, Lum's friends have managed to escape their confines, and Mendo manages to slice through the rope ladder that Rupa and Lum are on. Rupa lands safely, but Lum ends up falling over the side of the tower. Ataru falls after her, but as they fall they both argue that the other has been unfaithful. When Ataru claims that he is finished with her, Lum's horns manage to regrow, and she emits a large temperamental electrical charge, frying Ataru, before returning to the roof. She then claims she is going to stay with Rupa."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078948/,summary,"Revisiting his own 1948 post-war science-fiction-thriller film, ""Krakatit"", itself an adaptation of the prophetic 1922 Karel Capek novel by the same name, Czech director Otakar Vávra offers us a more modern view of this classic through this 1981 remake. The story centers around Prokop, a scrupulous scientist responsible for the invention of a highly-efficient explosive who, foreseeing the consequences of his invention once in the hands of those in power, spins into delirium as he faces the moral dilemma presented by his secret, then the crushing guilt and regret for his role in releasing such a potent tool of mass destruction unto the world, and the inevitable catastrophe that follows. The novel presaged the atomic age by two decades and even anticipated, three decades prior, the same deep ethical remorse that J.R. Oppenheimer, a ""father of the atomic bomb"", would later bring to public attention (ending in the revocation of all his security clearances). The themes presented in this 1981 remake are still very relevant, then and now, and its urgency is still fresh.—pdlussier1"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105667/,summary,"Dance in white Middle America up to the early 1950's was traditional ballroom, where dance moves were standardized. It was more a technical exercise than an emotional one. White youth of the period began to look toward the black community and rhythm and blues music, which gave them the sense of wanting just to move in a whole new way. For white Middle American youth, this music morphed into rock and roll. Despite establishment deeming rock and roll to be Satanic and/or Communist, it took off amongst the younger generation. The combination of rock and roll and dance was presented to American youth through Bandstand (1952), which told youth what the trends of the day were. However, much of the dance shown on network television was Caucasians trying to dance like black Americans, but with no hip movement. This changed with the dance ""The Twist"", which also revolutionized the concept of not being reliant on what one's dance partner was doing. Although it had its detractors, The Twist became fashionable across race, generation and socioeconomic status. It became more than a song and a dance - it became a commodity. Because of the craze, everyone was trying to come up with the next big thing, no one ever achieving that goal.—Huggo"

Backed by an American music mogul, he was poised to win the Eurovision Song Contest that would launch his career but a drinking binge caused him to wake up on a beach, still in his tuxedo and his chances blown. Instead of becoming an iconic performer, Nick embarked on a path of alcohol abuse that would see him slide into living on the streets, as an alcoholic vagrant in 60s & 70s London.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380115/,synopsis,"Pale Blue Light is a television drama series centered on a record company called Pale Blue Light Records. The show focuses on the behind-the-scenes of the hip hop industry and culture. This 30-minute program will deal with the drama and lifestyle and culture that is hip hop. Examples: The shady record deals, the struggles and squabbles defacing the business, the conflicts between labels and the ghetto-fabulous lifestyle that is hip hop. Our show directly targets the largest built-in television audience in the world - the ""Hip Hop Nation,"" the largest demographics on the planet, second only to the human race itself. The series will focus on the everyday lives of those who work at Pale Blue Light Records - at times a to-scale representation of the highly commercial industry as a whole, at others an intentional counterpoint - as the show's stars struggle to make ends meet while also trying to raise hip hop as an art back to the days of its genesis. The character development, smart dialogue and multidimensional drama are what will hook viewers outside of the world of hip hop; cameo appearances by real hip-hop artists, playing themselves, will blur the line between fantasy and reality. The series will also cover: the video shoot and what happens when the cameras stop rolling; entanglements between artists and their fans; the myths of the hip-hop industry; radio stations and TV networks and how a song gets air-play; the violence that plagues the industry; individual conflicts, mudslinging and power-tripping and the chain of unexpected incidents and mysterious events that reconstitutes Pale Blue Light Records as one of the hottest record companies in New York. As for the Ghetto-Fabulous Lifestyle, we'll get a firsthand look at the diamonds, mansions, Bentleys and Benzes - who owns, who rents and who fronts. The hip-hop audience only knows what they see on show like EMPIRE and POWER and what they read in trade magazines, and they're always curious to know more. The show will get its stories from the actual industry - we've assembled a panel of experts and consultants from within the industry to make sure of that. Pale Blue Light Records' purpose is not to denigrate the recording industry for its ills but rather to show what goes on in a fictional setting called Pale Blue Light Records. The key to keeping the show fresh and entertaining will be the writing, which will be intelligent and sharp and represent a multiplicity of voices and ideas, and, of course, the music, which will also not be limited to hip hop. The plan will be to showcase up-and-coming artists and write them into the storylines, giving them a huge promotional edge in selling records and a chance to break into the movie and television industry. The storylines will also project a lot of the positive attributes of hip hop, the idea being always to keep it real and true to form (the good, the bad ... the full register of the human experience), the way previous show in the past have done before like, The Sopranos with organized crime or Entourage has with the notion of living the Hollywood dream. The same goes for other HBO programs like The Wire's protracted gaze at the drug trade. The backdrop will be New York City, the city that gave birth to hip-hop. Perhaps the best way to describe this series would be a cross between Entourage and The Wire, where you experience life in the fast lane with expensive cars and mansions and the gritty thug-life of crime and disloyalty, but Pale Blue Light will have a distinctive advantage in marketing over these past successful shows: the lingua franca that is hip hop. This show will be marketed around the world, because hip hop is in Europe, Japan, South America, Canada, Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, etc. Additionally, every hip hop, youth-oriented, music, fashion
and ethnic magazine will want to cover Pale Blue Light; examples include: Details, Source, Vibe, YM, Ebony, Latino, Latina - the list goes on. That will also include tri-state radio exposure, Hip-Hop, R&B, Dance, and Top 40. As the popularity of the series grows, the more progressive the cameos by all different types of celebrities: actors, athletes and other types of musicians. Everyone will want to make an appearance on Pale Blue Light. The show will take root in New York, but the storylines will go beyond the coasts and midlands of America to the banlieues of Paris, the favelas of Brazil or the boroughs of South London, where the new breeds of hip-hop are evolving."

Born Roy Fitzgerald, Hudson treated who was known as ""Rock Hudson"" as being a studio creation that was somewhat outside himself. However, he sometimes was still ""Rock Hudson: movie star"" to those who knew him. Publicly, he had to maintain the façade of that creation, the public who saw in him a handsome, rugged, masculine yet likable and safe leading man and movie star. That façade included a short two-year marriage of convenience to Phyllis Gates. His movie career on the most part also supported that façade, especially when there was a foil of a more effeminate or nebbish male character playing against him.

This is the story about one of the few pioneering women who insisted on creating designs that are still popular today; despite the enormous consequences it had for her. She managed as a single mother and under difficult financial conditions to work independently. Combining humanist thinking with an almost scientific methodology, she analyzed her way into all her designs; working, reworking, testing. Her name was Grethe Meyer.—Isabel Bernadette Brammer"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14962518/,synopsis,"Danish designer Grethe Meyer graduated as an architect in 1947 at Royal Academy of Fine Arts as the only woman in her year, which at the time was so notable that it was mentioned in the newspaper. Her career started in a modest 2-bedroom apartment in Copenhagen, where she lived alone with her young daughter and at the same time worked hard to get her designs recognized and pay the bills. And that had its price. Prioritizing her career became devastating to her relationship with her daughter, but she was so dedicated as a designer that there wasn't room for much else.
Grethe combined humanist thinking with an almost scientific and systematic approach. She analyzed her way into her tableware and furniture designs; working, reworking, testing.
Grethe was a fighter for her cause. She was used to resistance, partly because she was a woman and because she was groundbreaking. She opposed men's old way of thinking by confidently sticking to her own ideas, which unintentionally gave other female artists the courage to stick to theirs. Her mindset was: ""I'm here because I'm great at what I do. Whether I'm a woman or a man doesn't matter. I'm good.""
This will be the first portrait film about the designer who, unlike many of her male colleagues, never has had her story told. We will through interviews and reconstructions get a unique insight into her thoughts and working methods. Her personal story as a woman, artist, pioneer, mother and lover is an interesting and vulnerable narrative that puts her career and legacy in perspective. As a designer, she has left us with functional designs that are still of great importance to people today. But few know that it's Grethe Meyer who's behind them and how much it has required of her."

This phase of her story begins in the pre-WWI era, when she begins work as a well-respected, well-liked bush nurse in the Australian outback of Queensland, near where she grew up. She decides on this work rather than to take a job in a Brisbane hospital under her mentor, general practitioner Dr. McDonnell, as was expected because she feels she can do more good in the outback. In her work, she encounters several cases of what she will learn is infantile paralysis aka polio, for which there is no cure. The remote diagnosis is made by renowned Brisbane orthopedic surgeon Dr. Brack via Dr. McDonnell, who in his telegram tells Elizabeth to treat the symptoms as best she can. In doing so, she is able to cure all her cases to the point of the children being able to walk unaided. Elizabeth is unaware of what she has discovered until she goes into the city and meets with Drs. McDonnell and Brack and learns that polio victims are generally treated by immobilization of the affected muscles, which requires splints, braces and aids to assist in walking. While Dr. McDonnell realizes what Elizabeth has done, Dr. Brack, an expert in the field, dismisses her cases as not being infantile paralysis, and he refusing to allow Elizabeth to demonstrate on or treat any acute cases in the hospital, he fearing for the patients' safety and well-being. As Elizabeth begins to be convinced by Dr. McDonnell that she has indeed discovered a new more effective treatment for polio, she begins to butt heads with Dr. Brack, who is convinced that she is a quack, largely because she is not a physician, let alone not one specializing in orthopedics. Dr. Brack is also able to convince the same to the medical community in orthopedics in Australia. Elizabeth has to decide how far she will take this fight, which if she does make it her mission to try to treat cases of polio and to make the Kenny treatment as it is called the new method of treatment within the general medical community, will be incompatible with a family life of her own, Captain Kevin Connors with the Australian Army, a longtime beau who wants to marry her.—Huggo"

His advice is to treat the child, according to the symptoms ... no more.Nurse Kenny is unsure what to do but, nevertheless, does what she thinks is best - which is to wrap the childs stiffened limbs in hot woolen sheets to relieve what she calls 'spasms'. Eventually the treatment seems to work, in that it relieves the twisted limbs but afterwards she discovers that the child is unable to move her legs. Again, unsure of what to do, but naïve enough to try anything, she decides that the childs muscles must have forgotten how to move and so proceeds to 're-educate' them.While treating Doreen, five other cases of the same disease arise in her area and she treats them all in the same way. All six children achieve a full recovery, however, Kenny is unaware of the importance of her accomplishment until she goes to see her friend Dr McDonnell in nearby Toowoomba.The reason for her visit to Toowoomba is to inform McDonnell of her impending marriage to a long time friend, Kevin Connors (Dean Jagger), who is just back from the War. According to nursing regulations at the time, her marriage means that she will no longer able to continue work. However, while she is there, McDonnell shows her the impact which a recent outbreak of Polio has had on the children around Toowoomba and cites a figure of 80 percent who have ended up with permanent disabilities and who face lives spent in callipers and on crutches. When Kenny shows Doreen (whom she happened to bring along for the ride) to him, he cant believe how healthy she is and is even more surprised when Kenny informs him that her five other patients are equally as well.He takes Kenny in to meet an Orthopedic specialist at the hospital, a Dr Brack (Philip Merivale), who hears Kennys story - and then examines Doreen - however he dismisses her ideas as foolish nonsense and says that it is obvious that Doreen must never have had Polio in the first place. Brack explains that every textbook ever written on the subject states that the muscles which extend as the childs limbs twist, is the one affected by Polio and that it was the Polio which caused it to become weak in the first place. He adds that the muscle on the opposite side of the limb takes control of it and it ends up pulling the limb out of alignment.However, Kennys treatment is based on just the opposite; that it is the shortened muscle which is diseased and that it has gone into what she calls a 'spasm', placing the sound muscle in a position where it is not being used - thus losing its ability to function. Her theory involves 're-educating' the under-used muscles by exercising until they are strong enough to resume normal use.This begins a forty year feud between the two, with Kenny seeing, first hand, the evidence that her treatment works (even with children Brack has given up on) and Brack clinging steadfastly to his established ideas - which involve immobilising the patients limbs rather than mobilising them - a treatment which Kenny sees as making the condition worse. Meanwhile, Kenny puts her marriage to Connors on hold, as she takes on the medical profession, and Connors is re-called for active service in Europe.Every time Kenny tries to have her treatment acknowledged, the medical establishment thwarts her but despite this, she gains notoriety by establishing clinics to prove her point. Children come form everywhere to be treated by her - with great success. But, still, the establishment will not budge. Eventually, a sympathetic Medical Director (John Litel), who is motivated by the great deal of public support being shown for Sister Kenny, sets up a Royal Commission. However, the Commission is dominated by Brack and other Orthopaedic specialists who convince it to reject Kenny's ideas - as well as her right to practice - threatening to prosecute her if she does.Time and time again she postpones her marriage to Connors in order to fight for her ideas and, time and time again, he continues to wait and gives his support until, eventually, it gets too much for him and he leaves, leaving both of he and Kenny heart broken.Kenny, her fame having spread world-wide, is invited to work in England where, once again, she achieves excellent results but is dismissed by the medical establishment. There to it forces her to cease her work. She returns home for a while only to be invited to work in the United States. When she arrives she is hailed as an anti-establishment rebel and a hero to the all the victims of Polio, only to be thwarted, once again by the inability of the medical profession to think laterally.Dejected and about to return home to Australia, Kenny receives an last minute invitation to practice in Minnesota, where a recent outbreak of Polio has motivated the State's Health authorities to try out her ideas.
With the support of the State's medical system, she achieves outstanding success but, once again, a Federal Inquiry finds her ideas to have no substance. Despite this, Kenny seems to take finds contentment in spreading the word among sympathetic doctors and seeing the benefits she can bring to her hoards of thankful patients.As the movie closes, Kenny is celebrating her birthday with her patients singing 'Happy Birthday' to her. Having given up the chance for love and having devoted her entire life to fight the medical status quo, she realises that her life has not been wasted - not in the least."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13721940/,summary,"A profile of actor Burt Reynolds, *the* movie star of his day in the late 1970s, is presented. His first loves, in no particular order, were football and women, he having had very high profile relationships, most notably, in order, with singer Dinah Shore, and actresses Sally Field and Loni Anderson, the latter who would become the only Mrs. Reynolds, the marriage which led to the other love of his life, being father to their adopted son Quinton A. Reynolds. Injury would sideline his potential football career, and would lead to him making his first foray into the acting class and eventually into acting as a career. With a number of supporting roles on television in the 1960s, he would go on to an acclaimed role in Amargo Pesadelo (1972), which marked the turning point in that acting career. With decisions to appear in the first ever male nude centerfold in Cosmopolitan magazine and continual appearances on the television talk show circuit, not as an actor plugging a movie, but as a witty and thus entertaining guest as an extension of his good ol' southern boy self, would mark him more as a movie star than a serious actor. With box office and thus financial success came he giving back to family and friends, and ultimately to the acting community in building the Burt Reynolds Theater and associated acting school in Jupiter, Florida. Physical and emotional pain, the latter from a lifetime of wanting to please, led to an associated struggle in his life in the 1980s, with a resurgence in the 1990s with an Emmy winning role in the sitcom Sombra da Noite (1990), and his only Oscar nomination for Boogie Nights: Prazer Sem Limites (1997), that movie a risk in if not acclaimed would also damage his public persona in portraying a not particularly likable character within the salacious world of pornography, those prior acting roles which made him famous being extensions of himself.—Huggo"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3538328/,summary,"They were the Grand Funk of Glam and the NY Dolls of Metal. Some considered Twisted Sister a joke, others called them the greatest bar band in the world. While the microcosm of Punk/New Wave was taking over NYC in the mid 70s - early 80s, Twisted Sister was battling their way to the top of a vast - and unique to it's time - suburban, cover-band bar scene that surrounded NYC in a 100 mile radius, yet existed in a parallel universe. Guitarist, Jay Jay French, says, ""the history of Twisted is really our 10 years clawing our way through the bar scene. It's who we are, and it's why we are, and why we do what we do."" The film follows them from their beginnings as a cross-dressing glam band playing 4 shows a night, 6 nights a week in New Jersey bowling alleys and Long Island beach bars, to the suburban mega-clubs of the late 70s/early 80s, to their bust-out appearance on the UK rock TV show, ""The Tube"". Through it all, Twisted stood ready to do or die for the sake of ""the show"", giving their all to the crowd, and demanding full attention in return. They refused to play the usual bar band role of ""human juke box for drunk and horny teens"" - you were going to be entertained whether you liked it or not. They regaled their audiences with comedy rants, dragging them on stage for vomit inducing drinking games, engaging them in fits of disco record smashing and, at their most extreme, whipping them into club-destroying frenzy. The performances were low on style and heavy on the humor and attitude - but behind it all, always smart and full of self awareness. Spinal Tap may have been clueless but Twisted Sister knew exactly what they were doing. It was both a great living and a dead end because once you reached the peak - headlining clubs attracting audiences of 2, 3 or 5 thousand a night - there was nowhere left to go. Because as big as Twisted got on that circuit, in the eyes of the world, ie the music establishment, they were nothing but a bar band. If you think you know them from their hit songs, the MTV videos and their massive stadium shows, this is the story of how they became that band - full of strange, and often hilarious, twists and turns. It's about Rock 'n Roll and the business of Rock 'n Roll. It's about perseverance and things blowing up in your face. It's about finding yourself, finding your audience and doing literally anything, however wild, to connect with them. And even though we know how it ends, the roller coaster ride of getting there is what it's all about. A mesmerizing, and wickedly funny story of a 10 year odyssey to overnight success.—Andrew Horn"

Everyday Americans heard their own music for the very first time, pure and unadulterated-this was a democratic revolution that would reverberate around the world."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6135232/,summary,"In search of the next big sellers, at the height of the Roaring Twenties music scouts from America's big record companies traversed the woods, hills, mountains and bayous of America - from the foothills in New York to the swamps of Louisiana. Putting out an open call for musicians, they set up shop in the biggest cities and allowed all comers to record, live, with their brand-new, cutting-edge lathe machine, writing the songs directly to wax discs. The recordings that they made captured the country's diversity - ethnically, artistically, geographically, economically - and for the first time, America heard itself, singing to escape the hard lives of cotton fields and coal mines. These music pioneers started a ""big bang"", and in the years to come, artists like the Carter Family, Will Shade, and the Memphis Jug Band would lead the country into a world-changing musical revolution. Morphing into new forms like church gospel choirs, raucous street-side bands, and blues that used any nearby items as instruments, the music quickly spread around the country and beyond its borders. Its popularity only fueled the search for more, and new genres were born almost overnight - genres that directly inspired many legendary modern musicians. Now, decades later, forgotten names on battered wax discs come back to life, as the filmmakers from American Epic cross 35 states over several years - tracking down some of the original musicians, family members, friends and eyewitnesses who were there to watch it all happen. With restored, never-before-used footage, photographs and audio, as well as new personal interviews (some of which are the last the person ever gave), The Big Bang is a celebration of America's rich musical heritage, and is the first part of a trilogy that Robert Redford calls ""America's greatest untold story"".—Lo-Max Films"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715670/,summary,"In 1968, two best friends joined an elite team and flew into a war zone wearing powder blue dresses. They were Red Cross Donut Dollies. These idealistic young women embraced their mission - to cheer up the GIs in Vietnam - with energy, creativity, compassion and resolve but had no idea what they were getting into. 47 years later, they reunite in Vietnam to retrace their steps; ask why they went; ask whether they made a difference; unlock buried memories and share their stories for the first time."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715670/,synopsis,"During the Vietnam War, a small group of American women volunteered for a Red Cross program that sent them into a war zone with almost no training or preparation. Armed with nothing but snacks, Kool-Aid and home-made entertainment programs, their mission was to be the girl next door, the sister and the shoulder to cry on for hundreds of thousands of American troops. They were ""The Donut Dollies"" - idealistic young women with no idea what they were getting into, whose lives would never be the same. Amazingly, over 50 years since the first Donut Dollies arrived in Vietnam, many people have still never heard of them. We want to change that.While shedding light on the story and shared experiences of the 627 Donut Dollies who served in Vietnam, this film will focus on two best friends - Dorset and Mary - who volunteered for the program together in 1968, at the peak of the war. As public opinion of the war plunged from bad to worse in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive and the My Lai Massacre, why on Earth would Mary and Dorset decide to risk their lives and futures to go to Vietnam? And once there, how could they possibly do their job? How could they cheer up troops who didn't know why they were there, and didn't understand why the people back in the States called them baby killers and spat on them when they got home?Seven days a week for a full year, the Donut Dollies acted as therapists, confidants, comedians and one-woman versions of the USO. Just like the GIs, they formed close friendships and life-long bonds. Just like the men, they saw friends die. Although they weren't on the front lines, they were shot at and they were caught in mortar attacks. Their lives were at risk every day, and, over the course of the war, three Donut Dollies died in Vietnam.As a result of their traumatic experiences and negative reception when they returned to the States, just like countless veterans, many Donut Dollies boxed up their memories when they got home - literally and figuratively - hid them away and never spoke about their experiences in Vietnam. In an intimate vérité style, we will follow Mary and Dorset as they ""unbox"" their memories and return to Vietnam for the first time in almost 50 years.Roommates in college, Mary and Dorset decided to become Donut Dollies together. But once they arrived in Vietnam, they got split up and never saw each other during their tours of duty. As they reunite to track down the places and faces that meant so much to them, we'll explore what compelled these young, college-educated women to jeopardize everything, postpone all their hopes and dreams and spend a year in a war zone. We'll also examine the impact this experience had on their lives after Vietnam - including silent battles with PTSD and the aftereffects of exposure to Agent Orange.For the Donut Dollies, being surrounded by thousands of young men who hadn't seen an American woman for months also brought with it a host of temptations and risks. They were supposed to be the ""girl next door"" - a wholesome, sisterly figure. How often was this actually the case? Though the Red Cross warned them not to get involved with soldiers romantically, many did. A few met their future husbands. Others thought they had, but were sorely disappointed. We'll explore these issues in the film as well, and they'll be brought to life through a powerful love story between Dorset and ""Pooch"" - a helicopter pilot she met in Vietnam.Pooch and Dorset fell madly in love while stationed together in Cu Chi. But then, Dorset was reassigned to another base. She was livid - upset enough to consider quitting the program. Did the Red Cross get wind of her relationship and reassign her as a result? She and Pooch were able to meet up a few times in Saigon and their relationship continued. However, though the opportunities arose, they decided to wait until they returned to the states to consummate their love. Almost a year later, after a romantic stateside reunion, all signs pointed towards marriage and a happily ever after.But then, Pooch broke off all ties with a single, cryptic card which only said, ""Silence is golden."" This devastated Dorset and has haunted and mystified her ever since. She tried to ask Pooch what this meant. He never responded, and essentially disappeared. Through the film, we will try to figure out what happened to Pooch, and what he meant by silence is golden.Unfortunately, the window to tell the story of the Donut Dollies is closing fast. Over the years, physical mementos have deteriorated and memories are fading, as most of the Donut Dollies are 65-70 years old. Almost all of Dorset's memorabilia has been lost or destroyed. Mary is battling a rare form of cancer that may be traceable to Agent Orange exposure. Every year, more Donut Dollies are passing away and those still here are getting older, frailer and more forgetful. This is the last chance for the Donut Dollies to tell their story in their own words.Presenting a new perspective on a tragic war that many Americans would still like to forget we fought, this is a story about brave women in a unique role few knew existed, exposed to horrors of war thought to be reserved for men, expected to smile through it all. This is the story of the Donut Dollies."

The cause of the explosion is a mystery, with all crew accounted for with the exception of two unidentified stowaways.Jeff Peters (Bing Crosby) and Orville 'Turkey' Jackson (Bob Hope) are seen floating at sea aboard a pile of wreckage. It was Jeff's idea to stow away, but it was Orville ""smoking in the powder room"" that caused the explosion. As the two joke about eating one another to survive, they spot land in the distance.As they sit on the beach, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy, to take care of him. Jeff reminds him that Aunt Lucy died before he could agree. They are interrupted by a convenient camel, and they hitch a ride.Once in the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs shooting guns, led by the sheik Mullay Kasim (Anthony Quinn). Jeff and Orville learn the sheik is pursuing a princess for marriage. Orville is approached by a group of bearers carrying someone in a veiled box. A beautiful hand takes his and then leaves, with Orville in pure bliss. In a restaurant, Jeff and Orville eat heartily, while trying to figure out how to get past the knife-wielding owner without paying. A man (Dan Seymour) takes Jeff aside and hands over a great deal of money. Orville is happy to be able to pay for the meal, until he learns that Jeff 'sold' him. Orville is furious, especially since neither of them know why the man bought him. Jeff calms him down and tells Orville he'll buy him back, eventually; and two men throw a hood over Orville and carry him off.A week later, Jeff is woken by a vision of Aunt Lucy (played by a harp-wielding Bob Hope) who shames him for his act. Jeff says he tried to buy Orville back, but learned he was re-sold to someone else. Aunt Lucy tells him he has to find Orville, and recommends singing Orville's favorite song.Jeff walks through the street singing, (accompanied by Aunt Lucy's ghost) until a note, with Orville's locket is tossed at him from the palace window. The note, written by Orville, says he's being tortured and warns Jeff of danger. Jeff, thinking Orville is in trouble, scales the palace wall. Hearing a woman singing, Jeff sneaks into the palace and see a lot of beautiful girls dancing for the beautiful Princess Shalmar (Dorothy Lamour) and singing to a very relaxed Orville.Jeff storms in and is grabbed by guards. Orville feigns ignorance and tries to send him away. The princess dismisses everyone, except for Jeff. Orville admits the truth, but it's clear he's still mad at Jeff. He says he and the princess are to be married. Jeff is surprised, but the princess says her wise man read the stars and told her to marry Orville. She was the one that passed Orville in the veiled box, and also the one that purchased him. As she plants a passionate kiss on Orville, Jeff decides to stick around; a decision that almost brings him and Orville to blows, but the princess invites Jeff to stay.As Orville is waited on by beautiful girls, he learns from one of them, Mihirmah, the princess was supposed to marry Kasim, but also tells Orville she loves him too. Jeff breaks up the party and confronts Orville, who has Jeff thrown out.Jeff wanders the palace singing, an act that attracts the princess and they go on a moonlit walk. Mihirmah tries to get Orville to run away with her. Jeff tries to tell the princess that HE was the one sold and should be marrying her, but he is interrupted by a sword-wielding Orville.The next morning an angry Kasim confronts Princess Shalmar for marrying someone else. He is prepared to kill Orville but the princess takes him to the wise man Hyder Kahn. Hyder Khan said he had read the stars and found that Princess Shalmar's first husband is destined to die a violent death within a week of the marriage, and the second husband would be blessed with long life and happiness.

The princess sends Orville away to get ready for the wedding. The wise man runs in and tells the princess and Jeff of the incorrect prophecy. The princess is happy and tells Jeff now she can marry him and not Kasim. Jeff realizes why Orville was so eager to get out of the marriage, but decides not to tell him. Instead he says the princess changed her mind, and Orville is only too eager to accept. Meanwhile the wise man's assistant tells Kasim, who rallies his men.The Princess and Jeff decide to get married in the U. S., accompanied by Orville and Mihirmah but they are confronted by Kasim, who takes the princess and gives Mihirmah to one of his men.

Sun Ra responds, ""You must be an expert at it."" Sun Ra tells the black guy he'll get paid nothing for the work he does through the agency. Sun Ra has a talk with a woman who steps in next. Sun Ra is still being monitored by the agents.Jimmy steps out of his parked car, ready to meet Sun Ra. He is being watched by one of the agents. The other agent pulls a gun out of a van. Later, in Sun Ra's spaceship, Jimmy runs a deal by him and the two men shake hands.Sun Ra is driven through the ghetto with two members of his entourage while Jimmy Fey interviews him. Sun Ra explains his philosophies about black men's place in society and music, as well as the ""alter-destiny."" The two youths from earlier listen to them on the radio, and debate whether Sun Ra has ""sold out"" or not.The contentious game in the desert goes on. The Overseer's card shows two black guys playing pool in a hall and talking. A very fat guy sits behind them, watching them.The Overseer pulls his car to a stop with Jimmy Fey and two women in it. They all get out, entering a brothel. The establishment's madam, Bertha (La Shaa Stallings), greets them at the door. The Overseer says he has ""two big men coming."" The group goes to an upstairs bedroom, where the women start to strip. The Overseer says to Jimmy, ""Wait for me outside."" A frustrated Jimmy leaves, then curses and protests beside a group of hookers.Two white men step to the brothel's door and are greeted by Bertha. She tells the women who came in with Jimmy and the Overseer that the men are aerospace technicians from NASA, and to have sex with them. The prostitutes start to party with the NASA technicians, but as it turns out, the men cannot perform sexually. One prostitute refers to the men as ""punks."" The Overseer and Jimmy barge in, spurring the NASA men to leave.The NASA men reenter the room where there are now three prostitutes and no Overseer or Jimmy; one of the men slaps two of the women around. Bertha steps in. The NASA men say their goodbyes to her, calling her a ""n*gger,"" and they leave.The name Sun Ra is displayed outside a concert hall. Two agents look at the display, taking pictures of it. Inside the hall, Sun Ra works on some music. One guy says to another that Sun Ra has been working for four days and nights straight, asking when he'll take a break. Sun Ra says, ""forces have been set in motion, forces that none of us can control.""Back in the brothel, the Overseer, Jimmy and Bertha tend to the bloodied women.In the desert, the card game continues.In the hall, Sun Ra's buddy tells him to go home and get some rest, and that he'll pick him up in time for the concert. Sun Ra leaves. The two black youths from earlier see as Sun Ra is captured and loaded into a van that is driven away. They hotwire a car, then get into it, eager to rescue Sun Ra. To their surprise, the fat guy from the pool hall appears in the back of the car.These three guys drive to the rescue, as people sit in the hall waiting for the concert. The agents interrogate a tied-up Sun Ra about his powers, such as ""transmolecularization."" Sun Ra doesn't talk, so they put headphones on his ears playing corny music. The agents leave him there while they go get something to eat.The three youths find the agents' van and open a garage door next to it. They race up some stairs, kick down a door and find Sun Ra. They untie him. The eating agents see the three guys drive off with Sun Ra and run back to their van, pursuing them in it.The Overseer and Jimmy Fey talk backstage at the hall. The Overseer remarks that there's no Sun Ra, and tells Fey to send the audience home. The hall is crowded. Fey attempts to entertain the crowd at a microphone and the discontent audience chants, ""We want Ra!"" repeatedly. Fey introduces Sun Ra, who has made it to the place. Sun Ra takes a seat onstage behind some keyboards. The Overseer stands back, waiting for what he calls Sun Ra's ""concession."" Sun Ra and the Arkestra perform some electronic music, with him and June Tyson doing some chanting together.The two agents from earlier step backstage, one of them holding a handgun. He points it at Sun Ra. The two youths who rescued Sun Ra see this. They run across the stage, and one of them leaps between the agent and Sun Ra. The agent fires his gun, accidentally shooting the youth. The surprised Overseer walks away. The fat guy grabs the shooter and pulls him to the floor. The other agent points his gun at Sun Ra, who makes the wounded youth and his friend disappear, only to show up in Sun Ra's spaceship. The youth who was shot is somehow unhurt and blows bubblegum. Sun Ra magically transports the fat guy to the ship, then he disappears himself.The Overseer returns to the brothel, saying, ""There's no way he can beat me this time."" He greets two seated prostitutes, one of them bandaged due to her beating from the NASA man. She vanishes, then the other one does too, both of them appearing in Sun Ra's ship.At the pool hall, the two guys from an earlier scene see the door mysteriously open. They stop playing pool, then one of them drops his dope-shooting tools onto a table and steps outside through a crowd gathered around Sun Ra's ship. This guy tells Sun Ra that he did drugs because he felt he didn't fit in anywhere. Sun Ra lets him onto the ship. Jimmy is also allowed onto the ship, but Sun Ra says that he will take Jimmy's ""black part"" with him, allowing Fey to go without it. In the brothel, the Overseer calls for Jimmy, who appears in front of him, his speech sounding more stereotypically ""white."" Another bandaged hooker sits beside the Overseer. Jimmy escorts her out of the brothel. The Overseer yells, ""RA, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" and storms outside.Sun Ra, surrounded by his entourage, says farewell to Earth, gets onto his spaceship, and it takes off. On the ship's monitor, we see the Overseer's car pull up to where the ship was. The Overseer angrily throws his hat down. Scenes of apocalypse can be seen on the ship's monitor.As the ship gets away from the Earth, the planet explodes."

Relationships end and hopes are occasionally dashed in this episodic drama, but few could complain that this isnt a thoughtful attempt to capture the sentiments of growing up in Hong Kong as we know it today.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1578778/,summary,"This is a story of the encounter and consequent cultural exchanges between inland, aboriginal Manobos and coastal, Visayan settlers in an ""out-of-the-way"" place in Agusan Valley, Caraga, Mindanao Island, Philippines. It explores, in particular, the varied embodiments of this social history in traditional Manobo song and ritual and in performances of recent, Visayan-brought electronically-amplified sounds. In Manobo ritual, spirits possess the body of the medium as a means of divination for curing, but these spirits indicate as well Manobo imaginative perceptions of their relationships with outsiders, including the Visayan spirit whose voice is incorporated in the Manobo body. With the introduction of modern cultural practices, Manobo rituals have been erased and displaced to the margins but some are altered, as in the incarnation of the Visayan spirit, to accommodate the unassailable Visayan presence that is felt in Manobo day to day life. This spirit is addressed as a friend, a form of recognition that resonates with the Christian compadrazgo social relation. Cultural exchanges come full circle with the performance of Manobo heritage in recent street ethnic dancing competitions with Visayans mimicking Manobos. Whether a spirit is incarnated in these festivals or not is a moot question. The mimicry seems instead to reproduce a mere pictorial representation of heritage minus its really real links to the world.—Jose Semblante Buenconsejo"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/,summary,"Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/,summary,"In the early twentieth century, the Great Leslie - daredevil and all 'round Renaissance man always clad in white - has several world records to his name in daring feats of courage, always with the faithful Hezekiah by his side. Leslie's arch enemy is the dastardly Professor Fate - always clad in black - who is always trying either to outdo Leslie or thwart Leslie's attempts of daring, without success. Leslie suggests to the Webber Motor Car Company that they show their engineering expertise by building the supreme motor car for a New York to Paris race, that car which they ultimately name the Leslie Special after their inspiration. Not to be outdone, Fate, with his equally dastardly sidekick Max, also enters the race with what he considers his motor car masterpiece, the Hannibal Twin-8. Nothing is too dastardly an act in Fate's goal of winning. One of the other entries is the beautiful Maggie Dubois, a reporter covering the race for the New York Sentinel newspaper. An emancipated woman, Maggie initially tried to convince both Leslie and Fate to use her as their driving partner, both who refused, considering her among the weaker sex. Maggie however convinced the newspaper both to hire her and to sponsor their own car with her as the driver based on the internal struggle within the newspaper's ownership, which is similar to Maggie's own struggles. Maggie expects to win: in her logic, she is covering the entire race (which she does with the use of some primitive but effective technology), meaning she needs to be first at the finish line. Despite being emancipated, Maggie is not averse to using her feminine wiles to her advantage. Through the race, they come across a few adventures and obstacles. But being a long race with much interaction between the racers, their mindsets and priorities may change based on their time together.—Huggo"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/,synopsis,"Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are reunited again, this time with Blake Edwards at the wheel of this epic farce. In an homage to the great silent stars--Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton--""The Great Race"" is classic slapstick and grand adventure combined.The film takes us back to the early days of automobiles, a time when there were hundreds of designers rolling out hand-crafted masterpieces fondly called 'motor cars.' The plot involves an around-the-world motor car race with Tony Curtis, representing good, always impeccably dressed in white and well-mannered. He is the gentleman adventurer and motor car enthusiast who has entered the race with a sporty white roadster. He opens doors and stops to help a lady, even if it happens to be in the middle of a race. Jack Lemmon plays the villain and Curtis' fiercest opponent, dressed of course all in black with a bumbling sidekick a la Lex Luthor in Superman. He drives what only a sinister scientist like Dr. Frankenstein could envision, a machine that is only an automobile in the loosest sense of the word. It is a child's fantasy of what should come standard with an internal combustion engine. There are more gadgets and contraptions that have nothing to do with motoring of course, but everything to do with killing the competition... literally. Curtis has Keenan Wynn as aide, assitant and butler rolled into one highly competent navigator. He is both caricature and anachronism as the misogynistic and chauvanistic eighteenth-century English man servant whose fidelity to position and service is constantly at war with his distrust of women. Right on cue Natalie Woods appears, as the sizzling suffragette supreme, perfectly adorned in full Victorian splendor and parasol to boot. Ms Woods is as stunning as ever and she does her damndest to befuddle Mr. Wynn. She plays the first female reporter for the establisment newspaper. In addition to Mr. Wynn, Ms. Woods bedevils the paper's editor by ignoring his every directive to stay out of the newspaper business and especially his office. His authority though is tenuous at best and constantly undermined by the incessant nagging from his bullying front lineman of a wife who is sympathetic to the women's movement embodied by Ms. Woods. He is well on his way to a nervous breakdown and emasculated to the point that he can no longer summon the resolve to deny Ms. Woods the choice assignment of covering the race. But, as only a true champion of women's rights could cover it, she does so undercover as a contestant, entering a motor car paid for, naturally, by the newspaper.""The Great Race"" is a romp as only a director and an experienced cast esembled here could pull off. It is a film that both celebrates and reinvents the art of story-telling on a big screen. Certainly it is the kind of classic film-making that has been forgotten in an era of big stars, short attention spans and revenue-maximizing studios who want the run time limited to double-digits so they can squeeze in another showing at the local cinelplex. Introduce this one to your kids, though. There is more than enough action and plenty of pratfalls to keep even the most hyperactive riveted to the screen."

David Dime (Garrett Hedlund), Mango (Arturo Castro), Foo (Mason Lee), Crack (Beau Knapp), Lodis (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley), Holliday (Ismael Cruz Cordova), and Skyes (Barney Harris). The squad has been going through a promotional tour with their producer Albert Brown (Chris Tucker). A rep from the Dallas Cowboys named Josh (Ben Platt) goes to pick up the team in a limo.Two days earlier, the squad was holding a funeral for their fallen sergeant Virgil ""Shroom"" Breem (Vin Diesel), whom Billy was trying to save in the video. After the funeral, Billy returned home to his mother (Deirdre Lovejoy) and sisters Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) and Patty (Laura Lundy Wheale).In the limo, Albert tells the squad that he is in the process of negotiating a deal to make a movie based on their heroics, joking that Hilary Swank wants to play Billy.During his training on tour, Dime and Shroom were aware that Billy had a criminal record before he was stationed out to Iraq. Billy explains that Kathryn was in a car accident that left her with multiple stitches on her face and lower body, leaving her with scars in the present. Her fiance dumped her in the hospital, prompting Billy to destroy the man's car and chase him with a tire iron. He signed up the next day so that the charges would get dropped.One of the Bravos' missions involved them raiding a compound to take down possible insurgents. They take down two men in front of their wives and children.

Crack replies by putting the guy in a sleeper hold until he passes out.We go back to October 23rd and see the event in full. Shroom went out to take on the insurgents and was shot badly. Billy ran in to save him, shooting the insurgents that came near him. Another one shot at him from behind a truck, only to get shot to pieces. Billy took Shroom into the foxhole, but another insurgent came toward Billy. Shroom grabbed the man's gun and gave Billy an opportunity to attack. After a brief struggle, Billy stabbed the insurgent in the neck until he bled out. Billy went over to Shroom, but he was already gone. Dime ran in and cried with Billy, telling him how proud he was of his actions.Billy and Dime later meet with Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin), the owner of the Cowboys who is also investing in the movie project about the squad. However, instead of the previous offer of $100,000 to each member of the squad for the movie, Oglesby has reduced it to $5,500 apiece, which infuriates the squad. Dime angrily rebuffs his offer. When Oglesby talks to Billy in private, he tells Billy that this story is no longer his, but it's now America's story. Billy also shoots down Oglesby's offer and joins Dime in refusing to do business with him.As the squad leaves, they get attacked by the stage manager and his goons. This gives Billy a full wave of PTSD imagery. The stage manager and his goons get arrested later.The squad is preparing to make their return. Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. He says he wishes he could run away with her even though he has to go back. They share a kiss before parting ways.

Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the commanding officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes (""lagaan"") on people from the local villages which they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that much to his regret, he is also bound by British law.It is after their visit to the Raja that the people of the village first witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into a fight with one of the British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province for three years if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times the amount of their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on the behalf of all villages without their consent. When the other villagers find out about the bet, they are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule.Bhuvan thus begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the people in the villages. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is also in love with Gauri. In an attempt to discredit Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villager's team in order to destroy it. Eventually, as the villagers realize that winning equals freedom, and as a few of them are insulted by the Britishers, they join the team. Still short one player, Bhuvan also invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl leg spin. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against untouchables, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, leading them to accept Kachra.The second half of the film focuses on the match itself. On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has lost his ability to spin the ball. In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. During the evening, however, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.The next day as part of his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and takes a hat trick which sparks the British batting collapse. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British Sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, while Deva was backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit by a bouncer on his head, and he falls on to his stumps. Other batsmen get out trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on his leg. The villager's team ends the day with 5 batsmen out of action with less than half of the required runs on board.On the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and reduces the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down 5 runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing only a single. However, the umpire signals no ball and Bhuvan returns to bat, and swings extremely hard at the next ball. Captain Russell backpedals and catches the ball, leading him to believe the British team has won. However, Russell caught the ball beyond the boundary which gives 6 runs, and the win, to Bhuvan's team. At that moment, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.Bhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the humiliated cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realizing that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London.

However, Jake's cowboy ways are unorthodox, but very effective when it comes to putting the criminal element out of business and after successfully putting a gang of drug dealers out of business, Jake's captain informs him that Interpol needs his help in Thailand to bust up a snuff ring that involves making and selling movies that involve people really getting killed. At first, Jake wants no part in it but after watching a confiscated tape, he is enraged to learn that the person who's starring in these snuff movies is Khan, a mountain of pure muscle, superhuman strength, deadly kicking abilities and most of all, possessing a ruthless fighting spirit. Many years ago, Jake's older brother Sean, who was a heavyweight kickboxing champion had just won his eighth victory in the rings of Thailand, even though someone had told him to throw the fight. Little did Sean know was that victory would be his last, as Khan and his thugs ambush him and his brother Jake. Sean succeeds in defeating the first wave of attackers, but Khan's style of fighting is so fast and brutal, that a three-kick combo puts Sean on his back (and into an early grave). Jake witnesses this and is consumed with rage for the death of his brother. Jake tries to fight Khan, but Khan just kicks the slime out of the youngster and he is orphaned and left for dead. Now an adult, Jake sees that the time for vengeance is perfect and he goes to Thailand, where one of the locals tells him that his skills won't be enough if he's trying to take down Khan. The local tells him that Prang, a drunken hermit with supreme kicking ability is the only one who ever came close to putting Khan on his back and that Jake should see him for training. At first, Prang is reluctant to teach Jake since his motive for going after Khan is vengeance, but decides to train him anyway since Khan is using his skills to kill people on tape. After telling Jake the story of how he lost to Khan, Prang begins Jake's days of training which has many painful trials; including ignoring blows to his body and avoiding Khan's three-kick combo technique. When Molly, a young wannabe model and supposed slave girl of Khan's gets caught up in the mix, Jake and Prang may be the only defenders left to stop Khan and bust up the snuff ring for good.—Keno Reeves (spywatcher459)"

He shows it to his mother (Louise Fletcher), who worries that due to an old shoulder injury he could become paralyzed if he competes.Meanwhile, Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) receives his invitation while he conducts a children's Tae Kwon Do class.At the tryouts, Travis Brickley (Chris Penn), a stocky athlete in a cowboy hat, refuses to share his adhesive tape with Alex. Tommy tosses Alex a roll of tape as Frank Couzo (James Earl Jones), the U.S. head coach watches. As the competition gets under way, Travis approaches Virgil Keller (John Dye), another competitor, and warns him to watch his face. Another athlete, Sonny Grasso (David Agresta), theorizes that Travis' bad attitude comes from his mother never having breast fed him. They watch Travis argue with the referee during a match and lose the bout. As he walks away, coach Frank Couzo tells Don Peterson (Tom Everett), his assistant, that Travis is ""a fighter.""After multiple matches, Couzo gives Mr. Jennings (John P. Ryan), the Olympic committee chairman, his list for the team. Although Jennings voices concern about Alex's shoulder, he announces that Alex, Sonny, Virgil, Tommy and Travis have made the team. Couzo takes the athletes into another room and reads them the rules, including never be late and act as a team. He explains they have three months to get ready for their first invitational bout against South Korea. They are shown to their living quarters and assigned roommates. Tommy is paired with Alex and discovers he is a widower. Across the hall, Don shows Sonny his computer discs containing statistics on every major Tae Kwon Do athlete in the world. In turn, Sonny shares his compact disc collection of rare opera performances.In another room, Travis dolls up for a night out, frustrated by Virgil's meditating. With only one night before training begins, they go to a bar where Travis flirts with another man's woman, and a bar brawl erupts. Frank Couzo arrives, takes a seat at the bar and enjoys the action. When the patrons are all knocked unconscious, Couzo orders everyone back to the bus. The next day, over his protests, the team is assigned Catherine Wade (Sally Kirkland), a sports psychologist trained in the mystic arts of the east. She explains that Koreans have been trained since birth in meditation and focus and that without her help the U. S. can never defeat them.The men are put through a brutal training regimen which includes yoga and meditation classes with Catherine. They learn that if there is a tie, a match will be decided by a show of strength, and are told to break five cement blocks with a karate chop. When no one volunteers to go first, Couzo picks Catherine to demonstrate. To everyone's surprise, she easily shatters every block. Travis maintains his surly attitude, making racist remarks to Tommy Lee and belittling Catherine's teaching.One day, Travis challenges Tommy to a fight, and when Tommy refuses, he asks if he is ""yellow."" Tommy responds ""obviously,"" and the room erupts in laughter. Later, the men watch video tapes of the Korean opponents they will be facing. Tommy learns he will be facing Korea's best, Dan Han Park. That night, Tommy dreams about being five years old and watching his older brother David compete against Dan Han Park in a tournament. Park kicks David in the head and kills him.The next day, Tommy and Travis are sparring when Travis tries an illegal move. Tommy uses jujitsu to throw Travis to the mat. Couzo takes Tommy aside to show concern that he did not finish Travis, fearing that if Tommy holds back during the tournament, Sae Jin Kwon will tear him apart. Three days before leaving for the Korea, Alex's son, Walter, is struck by a car. He tells Couzo he needs to go home, but the coach tells him if he leaves, he is off the team. Alex makes it home to find Walter is in a coma. The next day, Walter resumes consciousness, and Alex goes back to training camp, but Couzo refuses to let him back on the team.In practice, Tommy kicks Virgil unconscious. Tommy flashes back to David's death and runs out of the building. He tells Alex he cannot fight Dae Han because he is afraid he will kill the man, but Alex explains that he is only destroying himself by holding in his anger. Tommy shrugs him off and rides away on his motorcycle.Catherine breaks into Couzo's office to read Tommy's file, then accuses the coach of only caring about winning. Couzo explains that he was David's coach, and the boy died because he did not prepare him for the fight. His only goal in life is to make sure that never happens again. Later, Travis, Virgil, and Sonny tell Couzo they need both Alex and Tommy to win. Couzo merely tells them to be on the flight in the morning, then asks Alex to come back.Meanwhile, Tommy stops for gas and sees a boy drop his ice cream cone. The boy's older brother gives him his cone, making Tommy smile. The next day, Tommy arrives at the airport and Couzo welcomes him back.When the team arrives in Seoul, South Korea, Couzo tells the team that if they give one hundred percent, win or lose, they will be the ""best of the best.""

Tommy takes Alex aside and tells him it is up to them to bring in the victory. Alex leaps ahead in his match, but his opponent lands a lucky blow and taunts him. Alex leaps on him and both teams rush the mats, but are constrained by their coaches and security personnel.In the third round, the Korean dislocates Alex's shoulder with a flying kick. Couzo and Don beg Alex to forfeit, but knowing they will lose the contest, Alex orders Tommy to pop Alex's shoulder back into place. Catherine helps Alex go into a trance to control the pain, and he returns to the ring. With one hand tied to his side, Alex drop kicks the Korean out of the ring, winning the match.With the score 29 for South Korea and 22 for the U.S.A., Tommy faces Dae Han Park. Dae Han quickly scores three times, but Tommy recovers and beats him to the floor. Dae Han illegally kicks Tommy in the groin as the first round ends. Needing six points or a knockout to win, Tommy enters the ring. Dae Han throws another illegal blow, but the referee does not see it. Tommy recovers and scores again and again until he breaks his opponent's leg. Tied, with only 30 seconds left in the match, Dae Han struggles to his feet. Tommy flashes back to Dae Han killing his brother, and freezes, vibrating with rage. The buzzer sounds, and Dae Han falls to the mat, but wins the contest. Couzo takes Tommy in his arms and tells him he really won the match.Later, as the Koreans receive their gold medals, a bloody Dae Han hobbles over to Tommy. He tells him that ""to save a life with defeat is to earn victory and honor,"" then places his medal around Tommy's neck. Apologizing for David's death, Dae Han offers himself as Tommy's brother.

She opens a handful of birthday cards and steals the cash inside. Her first stop is Sbarro Pizza at the mall's food court, where she orders a Mountain Dew (the employee asks if she wants Diet like most women but she rudely tells him she didn't say Diet). When she is charged $9.30 for the meal, the owner comes by and points out that she's on the wall -- where an autographed picture of her is hanging. Thus her meals are always on the house. Hope is revealed to be a major celebrity in her small town of Amherst, Ohio, with the city sign even boasting that ""Bronze Medalist Hope Ann Gregory"" lives there. This special treatment carries over to the local soda shop she often eats at, complete with her own reserved parking spot. While drinking a milkshake, a young gymnast, named Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson), and the gym manager named Ben (Thomas Middleditch) spot Hope through the window. Maggie does an impressive routine outside the window and then enters, gushing about how she's a big fan of Hope's. Hope recognizes Ben as being ""Twitchy"", a kid she used to torment over his facial tic, which he still has; he seems to have always had a crush on her. Maggie tells Hope she's a gymnast training with the same coach and that Hope has been an inspiration to her since her father died at five years old. Hope replies by bragging that her mother died when she was a baby.When Hope returns home, her dad politely tells her she can't steal from his mail truck anymore. Stan tells her she should get a job coaching gymnastics and she points out that she was currently on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and is a star, not a coach. Nonetheless, he suggests retracting her weekly allowance. She balks at this, complaining that she needs that $700 a week to get by. They settle down with him holding a DAD'S GREATEST DAD mug that she made for him in grade school. They watch television in which it's revealed that the coach who trained Hope to the Olympics has killed herself. Hope is nonchalant in response to this, saying she hates the coach.The next day, Hope goes to meet her drug dealer to score some weed. She tries to steal from her dad's mail truck again but it now has a lock on it. After she gets the hook-up, she comes home to learn that her father has received a letter, stipulating that in her former coach's will, Hope was left half a million dollars, on the condition she coach Maggie to the Olympic games, regardless of how she places. Hope reads the letter and tells him it says $500,000, not half a million. Yet she decides to take up the offer. She stops by Maggie's trailer home and meets her mom (Cecily Strong) and tries to convince her to let her train Maggie. They both agree, excitedly, as they are fans of hers. Maggie points out she needs a ride to the gym because she is too young to drive. She says she usually gets there by 7:00 AM but Hope promises to pick her up around noon.Their first training session, Hope goes out of her way to sabotage Maggie's chances of success. She encourages her to binge on junk food, pointing out that male athletes do the same thing in other sports. A boy flirts with Maggie and instead of telling her not to get distracted, Hope demands that Maggie be intimate with him. When they arrive at the gym, Ben/Twitchy is there. Hope says she's going to give her a new routine even though Maggie already has one she's been working on with her former coach. She asks Maggie if she knows what the strongest part of her has to be to win -- Maggie guesses mental constitution but Hope corrects her, ""Your mind,"" which is the same thing. Instead of actually running through the routine, Hope encourages her to lay down and visualize her performing it; she never runs through the actual routine.The next day, they have to get to the gym early because a committee member is going to arrive to evaluate Maggie. Hope blends some weed into a green smoothie she's making for Maggie and then decides to throw in the whole bag. She tells Maggie that she must drink the whole thing. When they arrive at the studio, Maggie's eyes are bloodshot and she runs around the gym, completely high. Ben is disappointed and questions whether Hope is the best coach for her. Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan) arrives; he is an equally conceded gymnast-turned-coach who won gold and silver at the Olympics and bickers with Hope. He took her virginity right after she won the bronze medal and they are now sworn enemies. Hope decides to quit her training and calls her dad at home, asking if she'll still get the money if she doesn't finish the task. She is told the conditions explicitly state that she has to succeed or she gets nothing. Because of this, Hope decides to change her tune -- she finds Maggie and her mom at home, talking to Stan who tries to encourage Maggie's mom to let him coach instead. Surprisingly, Maggie and her mom decide to stick with Hope.Hope tries a different approach -- she encourages Maggie to stop kissing the boy she initially told her to. She puts her on a strict diet but tells her to sniff Hope's nachos before eating her celery stick, a trick she knew from her own gymnastics days. She gives Maggie pointers on how to do a cutesy routine to impress the judges. And how to stick a landing.Impressed, Ben begins to like the new Hope and the two decide to go out on a date. He takes her to the mall food court from before but after hours, using a kiosk selling candles to spark a mood. They play Truth or Dare and she dares him to steal a punch card from one of the restaurants -- and then to punch them out so she gets a free meal. Eventually the game gets more serious where she talks about how crushed she was when she finished rehabilitating from her broken leg and was told by her now deceased coach that she was a has-been and her career is over.Maggie makes it into the nationals in Toronto, Canada and everyone gears up to attend except Maggie's mom who has to stay home and work. Ben and Hope continue getting closer and Lance is there, too. An interviewer asks Hope if she is coaching because she is no longer a star and Hope gets upset. She later admits to Ben that she's afraid that if Maggie succeeds, she won't be the city's local celebrity anymore. He tells her he thinks it's great that she's coaching Maggie especially since the gymnastics studio isn't going to be around much longer because of money problems. He suspects that this is why the studio's owner killed herself because she was going through hardships financially and was broke. Hope now realizes that she doesn't have $500,000 to pay her.Hope finds her dad in her hotel room and demands to know if the letter was real. Stan finally admits that he falsified the document to encourage Hope to get a job and make something of herself. She is angry with him but for the first time, he stands up to her, calling her a ""spoiled bitch"".Upset, Hope gets drunk in at a bar and Lance begins to flirt with her. Back in her motel room, they have a hot five-minute sex session, which includes them doing gymnastics moves in the fully in the nude (i.e., he does moves on her like she's a pommel horse; she does a front flip into a handstand and they 69). It ends with her holding onto rings while he bangs her against the window. Ben is in the parking lot and sees this happening.The next day, Ben is livid with her and tells her he saw her having sex. He wants nothing to do with her, which crushes Hope. Lance admits that he's always hated her and he had sex with her so he could ruin her relationship with Ben. He wants to take Maggie to the Olympics and steal Hope's small town celebrity away from her.Maggie is about to perform her routine. Hope sees Maggie's mom high in the stands; she asks Hope to tell Maggie she's there. Hope finds Maggie ready to perform for the judges; she begins to tell her 'Your mom--"" and stops. Maggie asks, ""What about my mom?"" Hope replies: ""She won't be here because she was killed in a plane crash."" Maggie begins to cry and when she goes to perform, she can't do it as she's too upset. However.... this is all just a fantasy in Hope's mind -- she tells Maggie the truth that her mom is there as a surprise, which makes Maggie smile. She gives a great performance and goes on to win a gold medal, allowing her to move on to the Olympics.Back in Amherst, the town now changes the sign to ""Home of Maggie Townsend, gold medalist"" and a smaller sign, ""and Hope Ann Greggory, bronze medalist."" Everything Hope feared has come true. At the local soda shop, Hope watches on TV as Maggie holds a press conference, telling her she couldn't have done it without her coach, Hope Ann Greggory... but then adds that being a gold medalist is going to be much more effective on her path to Olympics and announces she'll be moving to Los Angeles and trained by Lance instead. The soda shop owner calls Maggie a bitch and Hope acts somber. Hope then walks out after paying for her milkshake.At the local mall, kids are lined up to get an autograph from Maggie who is a no show because she has moved out of town. Hope stands on the table and gives a speech to the kids using foul language but encouraging them to join the local gymnastics studio.Ben shows up to the gymnasium, which is slated to close, but instead finds a swarm of girls and their moms outside. Hope is selling them gym clothes and T-shirts and says she won't be granting any change; all profits will go to keeping the studio around.In the final scene set several months later, the gymnasium is still open and Hope is now the official coach in town teaching gymnastics to young girls. The city changes the sign back to simply ""home of bronze medalist Hope Ann Greggory."" But Hope isn't that great of a coach. During a lunch break, an ice cream truck comes by and Hope sends all the athletes outside to get some for themselves.In a post write subtitle sequence, we're told that Maggie didn't win a gold medal at the next Summer Olympics, and had to quit gymnastics after having Lance's baby. Also, that none of the girls that Hope trained at her new gym ever went on to win a medal at any event."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1456635/,synopsis,"Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) from Massachusetts, feels ostracized from his family, his father (Eugene Levy) and brother both being doctors. One day he attends a minor league hockey game with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel). Pat taunts the visiting team during a fight and one of their players climbs into the stands. Doug, in defense of his friend, quickly knocks him out, which prompts the rest of the crowd to cheer him on. Soon after, Doug gets a phone call from the coach of his hometown team who offers him a job as an enforcer, a player whose role is to protect his teammates and act as a deterrent by hitting or fighting opposing players who take liberties with his teammates.In the meantime, veteran enforcer and Doug's idol Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (Liev Schreiber) is demoted to the minors after serving a 20 game suspension for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Three years prior, Rhea hit and concussed the highly skilled prospect Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) who has had trouble recovering from that incident due to the fear of being hit, being stuck in the minors and falling in with the wrong crowd. After earning himself the nickname ""The Thug"", Doug is called up to Canada and hired by Laflamme's team, the Halifax Highlanders, to protect Laflamme and be his roommate.The Highlanders experience success with Doug as their primary enforcer, and he quickly gains popularity among fans and teammates much to the chagrin of his parents and Laflamme, particularly after losing ice time and the alternate-captaincy to Doug. Doug becomes romantically involved with Eva (Alison Pill), a hockey fan with a penchant for players.With 4 games left on their schedule, the Highlanders need two wins to secure a playoff spot. On a road game in Quebec, after an opposing player concusses Laflamme with a heavy hit, Doug savagely beats the player unconscious and is suspended for the next game against Rhea and the St. John's Shamrocks. Doug encounters Rhea at a diner, where Rhea dismisses Doug's claim that he is a hockey player, calling him a goon. Rhea warns him that if they ever meet on the ice, he will ""lay him the fuck out."" The Highlanders, with Doug suspended and Laflamme hospitalized, lose to the Shamrocks.Doug reaches out to Laflamme, and promises him he will always have his back on the ice. In their next game, the Highlanders lead 1-0 thanks to renewed teamwork between Doug and Laflamme. In the dying seconds, Doug blocks a slapshot with his face and his ankle is broken in the ensuing scramble. The Highlanders win, but need a win against Rhea and the Shamrocks in their last game for a playoff spot.After two periods, the Shamrocks are beating the Highlanders 2-0. Rhea and Doug drop the gloves in the third period, and dole out and receive physical punishment during the fight. Doug is knocked down first, but Rhea calls off the referees and allows him to get back up. Doug manages to break Rhea's nose, but breaks his previously injured ankle in the process. Doug manages to stand back up and knocks out Rhea with a vicious cross. Eva and his teammates help a seriously injured Doug off the ice and Laflamme, inspired by Doug's efforts and Rhea's demise, scores a hat-trick to lead the Highlanders to a 3-2 victory and a play-off berth.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116000/,synopsis,"The Ducks are being awarded junior varsity hockey scholarships to Eden Hall Academy, a prestigious prep school that coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) attended, following their victory at the Junior Goodwill Games in Los Angeles, California. Bombay announces that he will be leaving his position as coach to take a job with the Junior Goodwill Games, much to Charlie's dismay. Bombay's spot is filled by former Minnesota North Stars player Ted Orion (Jeffrey Nordling). Initially the Ducks clash with Orion's disciplinary coaching tactics and his focus on defense over scoring. Orion abandons several Duck traditions, including starting Julie Gaffney in goal over Greg Goldberg, based on Julie's superior play in tryouts, directing the team to play a defensive-minded system and strips Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson) of his Captain's 'C', stating that the strategies the team used in the past won't work anymore. He is proven right when, in their first game, the Ducks take an embarrassing tie after losing a 9-goal lead, due to their cockiness after their initial dominance. Orion is livid, but makes a valid point (about hockey and life) when he states that the Ducks won't be able to dominate every game and have to learn how to play ""two-way hockey,"" not choking when the game is going their way. Charlie's only consolation is meeting Linda (Margot Finley), a student petitioning to change the school's team name (The Warriors) as it perpetuates an offensive Native American stereotype. Though she initially writes him off as a mindless jock, the two start to hit it off.The team's difficulties are further compounded by the attitude towards them on the part of most of the students and parents at Eden Hall, particularly the Varsity hockey team, which Adam Banks has been recruited into. The two teams engage in an escalating prank war, culminating in an unofficial match in the school's ice rink, in which the Ducks are badly beaten. When Coach Orion forbids the old Ducks name and uniforms, declaring ""The Ducks are dead"", Charlie finally becomes fed up with Orion, whom he considers washed-up, and leaves the team with Fulton Reed. Greg Goldberg is made a defenseman to replace Fulton. Venting to Hans, his and Gordon's mentor, Charlie becomes further upset after Hans appears to take Orion's side. After skipping school at the Mall of America and Charlie proposing going to public schools before pursuing hockey careers, Fulton realizes he might not want to follow Charlie or play hockey for the rest of his life. He also tries to suggest Charlie rejoin the Ducks. Chagrined at that suggestion and Fulton's abandonment, Charlie is still struggling with what to do when he learns that Hans, the Ducks' friend and mentor, has passed away.Bombay returns for Hans' memorial and the next day takes Charlie back to Eden Hall. He explains to Charlie, that Orion was actually a great pro player who only left the sport because he wanted to care for his daughter, a paraplegic as a result of a car accident he was in. Bombay explains the circumstances that led to his coaching the Ducks in the first place and how it changed his life for the better, and that he told Orion that Charlie was the heart and soul of the team, and it was his hope that both Orion and Charlie would learn something from each other. Touched by this, Charlie agrees to rejoin the team.Arriving at the team bus for the next game, Charlie apologizes to Orion who, surprised by Charlie's sincerity, welcomes him back. Fulton also rejoins the team before Charlie does, apparently no longer disillusioned about hockey. Adam also decides to leave the Varsity team and return to the JV team. Prior to the bus' departure, Dean Buckley (David Selby), the school's headmaster, informs the team that its board of trustees is going to vote to revoke the Ducks' scholarships, due to the unpopularity of the decision to admit them, and their mediocre performance on the ice. The Dean offers Orion a chance to start anew with a team of his choice, but Orion refuses, going so far as to threaten resignation, and assures his team that he's going to fight the decision.At the Board of Trustees meeting, the Ducks state their case, but no one is willing to listen until Bombay arrives and threatens the group with an injunction, promising to tie up the matter in court until long after the kids have gone on to college. The board reluctantly votes to reinstate the Ducks' scholarships. When the Varsity team learns the Ducks are staying and continue their harassment, the Ducks and the Warriors agree that if Varsity beats JV in the upcoming exhibition game, JV will leave the school, but if JV wins, the official team name will be changed to the Mighty Ducks. Orion and the Ducks train hard, focusing specifically on defense around the goal. Orion returns the Ducks' jerseys right before the game, feeling that the team has finally earned them.Throughout the game, the Varsity dominates on offense, but the Ducks' newly acquired defensive skills manage to keep the game scoreless after two periods. Unable to score, the Varsity instead start to viciously check every player they can, so that the Ducks are battered going into the third period. During the second intermission, Dean Portman (Aaron Lohr), who had initially refused the school's scholarship, returns to the team, adding a needed spark.

The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn is now a yuppie who feels like he's lost his edge on his fastball.

Also, minor league catcher Rube Baker is called up to the Indians, even though Rube has a throwing problem. The signing of Jack Parkman has put Roger in a financially tough spot, so Roger later trades Jack to the Chicago White Sox, the team that stopped the Indians from going to the World Series last season.

The police tell him his father was killed while caught cheating in a card game by Andre Rivage, an arrogant young dilettante.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047011/,synopsis,"In the early 1800s, Vance Colby eagerly anticipates reuniting with his father, famed gambler Chip Colby, after a four-year separation. Vance, who was in Texas fighting with the Louisiana Volunteers, is accompanied on his boat voyage by his father's attorney, Pierre Bonet. Pierre is playing poker with an arrogant German named Gottwald, and when he continues to lose, Vance wins back his money with one hand. After they disembark, Gottwald learns that Vance's father is Chip, so named because of the diamond chip cuff-links he wears, and he accuses Vance of learning to cheat from his father. The two men engage in a fistfight, which Vance wins, but as he is turning away, Gottwald charges at him with a baling hook. Gottwald is knocked unconscious by frying pan wielded by feisty Melanie Barbee, the daughter of river boat captain Antoine Barbee, and although Vance expresses his gratitude, he is oblivious to Melly's admiration of him. As they are riding home, Pierre explains that Chip has important news, but their journey is interrupted when they meet the lovely Yvette Rivage, whose carriage has a lame horse. Vance swaps his horse for the lame one and accompanies Yvette home, and her initial disapproval of his forwardness melts as they laugh together in the rain. Upon reaching Yvette's estate, Araby, Vance meets her brother Andre and suitor, Claude St. Germaine. The aristocratic Rivage and Claude tell Vance about their new venture, a luxurious gambling boat called the Baton Rouge , but when they find out who he is, cast aspersions on his father's honesty. Yvette is horrified to discover that Vance is a gambler, and to prevent him from seeing her again, Rivage sends his vicious foreman, Etienne, to kill him. Although Etienne succeeds in knifing Vance in the back, the gambler escapes in a small boat out to the river, where he is rescued by Melly and Barbee. The next morning, the recovering Vance teases Melly that if she saves his life one more time, she will gain full possession of him, while Barbee relates how Chip, once known as ""the gambler from Natchez,"" saved him from losing his boat to a cardsharp many years earlier. That afternoon, Vance goes to Chip's hotel in New Orleans and is stunned to learn that his father is dead. He questions Police Commissioner Robert Renard, who tells him that, during a card game the previous evening, Chip was accused of cheating and killed by a Creole gentleman. Renard reveals that Rivage is the man who killed Chip, and Vance bitterly disparages his eagerness to believe a ""gentleman."" Vance also asserts that Andre's witnesses-Claude, casino owner Nicolai Cadiz and waiter Rene Garonne-could be lying, and Renard warns him that he cannot take revenge by dueling with his enemies unless he is publicly challenged. That night, Vance goes to Cadiz's casino, the St. Cyr, where he questions Garonne. He is interrupted by Cadiz, whom Vance accuses of aiding Rivage in killing his father. Vance then abducts Garonne, taking him to Barbee's boat, and there Garonne reveals that Andre had lost his share in the Baton Rouge while playing cards with Chip, and when he wagered and lost the deed to Araby, he grew so enraged that he shot Chip in cold blood. Cadiz then switched the cards to make it appear as if Chip had been cheating. Garonne adds that both Cadiz and Chip were partners with Rivage and Claude in the ownership of the Baton Rouge , and Vance realizes that this was his father's important news. Garonne agrees to make a sworn statement about the affair, but during the night, is kidnapped from Barbee's boat. In the morning, Melly goes to Vance's hotel to apprise him of the news, and also upbraids him for staying in the hotel in which Yvette keeps a suite. Vance, who had not known about Yvette's presence, confronts her with the knife used to wound him, and she reveals that it is Etienne's. When Yvette then questions Rivage and Claude, they lie, telling her that they were not involved with the attempt on Vance's life. In town, Rivage and Claude attempt to frame Vance for Garonne's murder by leaving his corpse in Vance's room, but Claude is still in the room when Vance and Renard enter. Vance pursues the fleeing Claude, who climbs to the roof and in his terror, falls to his death. Soon after, Barbee pretends to be a rich plantation owner and goes to the St. Cyr to gamble, and while he is at the table, Vance alerts gambling commissioner LeClerc that the dealer is using marked cards. LeClerc revokes Cadiz' gambling license, and the infuriated Cadiz challenges Vance to a duel. The next morning, Melly watches as Cadiz shoots first but misses. Vance offers not to shoot if Cadiz will sign a confession about Chip's death, but when Cadiz draws a derringer, Vance is forced to shoot him in self-defense. Fearful that Vance will kill him next, Rivage asks Yvette to invite him to the opening of the Baton Rouge , and without her knowledge, plans to kill him. Barbee and Melly accompany Vance to the event, and after Rivage tries but fails to compromise Vance by having Yvette found in his rooms, Rivage orders the captain to put Vance off the boat because he is a professional gambler. Vance responds that as co-owner of the boat, he is not subject to Rivage's orders, and offers to play a game of blackjack for total control of the Baton Rouge . Vance wins the game, after which Rivage wagers again, using Araby as his stake. When Vance wins, Rivage draws his sword and soon the pair are battling throughout the boat. Eventually Vance succeeds in killing Rivage, and later, returns the deed to Araby to Yvette. Although Yvette invites him to stay with her, Vance declines, telling her that his place is with Melly aboard the Baton Rouge."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4677288/,summary,"The film Paradise North and Sound appears as a distinctive séance or a dream centered on spatial disorientation. Since the historical avant-garde and the Balhaus, art and cinema have been interacting with each other in many different contexts (Hollywood cinema, Joseph Cornell, Weegee, 1960s experimental filmmaking, Fluxus, French New Wave, Warhol) and with different concerns and effects for filmmakers and artists. This film continues reflecting on a complex, problematic relationship between cinema, sound and art, especially as represented by painting and drawing. In a way, it is reminiscent of German abstract filmmakers like Viktor Eggeling's Symphonie Diagonal, Oskar Fischinger, Walter Ruttmann and Hans Richter whose abstract films were inspired by painting, graphics, drawing, music and the aesthetic ideas declared in Kandinsky's On the Spiritual in Art. White-Sobieski's ability to generate film animation as real and unreal at the same time makes him a cinematographer in art and a painter in filmmaking. His lesser-known multimedia art projects (Cityscapes series, Hudson River, Birds, etc.) are cinematic in visual qualities, while his films are recognized as ""painterly"". Looking at Paradise North and Sound, the viewer receives a new perspective of the artist's previous work in abstract film - Moving Paintings (1999-2003), Moving Drawings (2002-ongoing), Mechanical Bird (2003), Terminal Dream (2004), New York City Suite (2005). The specific aura of White-Sobieski's digitized images alludes to the otherworldly spaces and represents the vertiginous state of mind of his character. Altered perceptions of time and place have appeared earlier in the artist's more narrative films; in Confession, Before They Were Beatles, Sweet Dreams, Queen Mary; history, landscape, and a trance-like utopia address the past and the future as they collide into one brief moment. Filmaker is in search of an experience of time that is transient and that can only be manifested as ""painting of time"". The idea of the film Paradise North and Sound is a continually moving contemplation of success and failure, an attempt to find a balance in time. This film is comprised of a drawn artwork, analog and digital footage, archival images, and a soundtrack that conjure the artist's inner world. It all translates into lyrical pieces that reflect both delight and an undertow of complex emotion. The filmmaker's control over the film medium comes from a deep knowledge of the involved technology. He always works without any technical assistance, creating his own codes for each new film. In Paradise North and Sound , the technology is complicated to the extreme; the project took as much hard disk space as a two-hour Hollywood motion picture. Notwithstanding all the complexity of the work, White-Sobieski manages to submerge the viewer into a meditative mode. This mode shifts from watching an image, to being in and part of a psychological environment.—American Cinematographer"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023876/,synopsis,"Throughout the movie, the passage of years is indicated by dates on title cards, with a Medieval cavalcade marching in the background.On New Year's Eve 1899, upper-crust couple Jane (Diana Wynyard) and Robert Marryot (Clive Brook) return to their London townhouse to keep their tradition of toasting to the new year. Jane is worried because Robert has joined the City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the Second Boer War, where Jane's brother is already fighting. The Marryots' butler, Alfred Bridges (Herbert Mundin), has joined the CIV as a private and will also be leaving soon; his wife, Ellen (Una O'Connor), and her mother, Mrs. Snapper (Tempe Pigott), are worried about what will become of Ellen and their baby, Fanny, if Alfred is killed or seriously wounded in action, but Alfred remains optimistic. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families toast to the new century.Shortly thereafter, Jane and Ellen bid emotional farewells to their husbands as they leave on the same ship. Jane's friend Margaret Harris (Irene Browne) keeps her company and supports her while Robert is away. While the two women are attending an operetta, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred return home, and the former is knighted for his services.Alfred announces that he has bought a pub with money partly provided by Robert, and that he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff celebrates Alfred's return, they receive news of the death of Queen Victoria.In 1908, Alfred has become an alcoholic and is managing the pub poorly, spending the family's rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny (Bonita Granville) are embarrassed by Alfred's behavior. Ellen carefully plans a social evening when Jane and her son Edward (John Warburton), now attending the University of Oxford, visit the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he cannot attend due to a leg injury. However, just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up at the house drunk, acts rudely, and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny. Fanny runs out onto the street; an angry Alfred goes after her, only to be run over and killed by a horse-drawn fire engine.On July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny encounter the Marryots at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she now owns the pub and she and Fanny, who has become a talented dancer and singer, are living off its proceeds. Edward has fallen in love with his childhood playmate, Edith Harris (Margaret Lindsay). The family witnesses the historic flight by Louis Blériot over the English Channel.In April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon aboard a luxurious ocean liner, revealed to be the ill-fated RMS Titanic. (The couple's death in the ship's sinking is only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.)In 1914, World War I breaks out. Robert and Joe (Frank Lawton), the Marryots' other son, both serve as officers, believing the war will be over in a few months. While on leave, Joe encounters Fanny (Ursula Jeans), whom he remembers from their childhood, performing in a nightclub. He reintroduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a Zeppelin air raid on London from the rooftop. Fanny later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love; unbeknownst to his parents, he spends most of his leave time with her. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to accept because of their class difference.Just after armistice is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's affair, visits Jane, reveals the relationship to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. Jane is surprised, but refuses to meddle in her son's personal life. As the two women argue, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle, and faints. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly and silently through armistice celebrations in Trafalgar Square.Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future."
